## Installation
Install using Composer
```
$ composer require rocketweb/theme-frontend-prime
```

Theme package comes bundled with two modules: UiCore and CheckoutEnhancement. You'll need to install them using Magento CLI:
```
$ bin/magento module:enable RocketWeb_UiCore
$ bin/magento module:enable RocketWeb_CheckoutEnhancement
$ bin/magento module:enable Staempfli_ImageResizer
$ bin/magento module:enable Magefan_Blog
$ bin/magento setup:upgrade
```

> To test if the theme has been installed correctly you can go to **Admin > Content > Design > Themes**. You should see RocketWeb/prime as one of the available themes.

## Supported modules
RW Prime is compatible with the following third-party modules that we highly recommend to install to take full advantage of the theme features:
- [WeltPixel_OwlCarouselSlider](https://www.weltpixel.com/resources/OWLCarouselSlider/User-Guide-WeltPixel-Banner-Slider-OWL-Carousel-Magento2.html)
- [Magefan_Blog](https://magefan.com/magento2-blog-extension)

## Usage
To start working with the Prime theme make sure to create your own custom theme that inherits from RocketWeb/prime. You can put all of your customizations in there but make sure not to modify the Prime theme files as your changes will be wiped out when the theme has been updated.

Here's a sample theme.xml file for your own theme:
```
<theme xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="../../../../../lib/internal/Magento/Framework/Config/etc/theme.xsd">
    <title>Your Own Theme</title>
    <parent>RocketWeb/prime</parent>
    <media>
        <preview_image>media/preview.jpg</preview_image>
    </media>
</theme>
```

## Development
This theme is in constant development. If you want to contribute by fixing bugs or adding new features use our [github repo](https://github.com/rocketweb-fed/magento2-theme-prime). Just fork the repository, push your changes and create a PR. Once your submission is reviewed and accepted we'll merge it to our develop branch and ship with the next release.
